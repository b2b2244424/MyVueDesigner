# MyVueDesigner
This project is a tes project to develop a visual web ui designer.It's used for vue developers not for designers.My initial purpose is making developing web ui more easily.This project is not started on my own.I studied two project.One is pageDesign.The other is Tenon.If you downloaded my source.you may find out its source is very similar to this two project.I wrote it with typescript.If you are using typescript.Then you may understand my code easily. I want to generate component and page source based on designer.But actually I can not do it perfectly.If you use this tool.please remember:this tools still has a long way to go.
